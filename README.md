<h1>Battleship</h1>

<p>This traditional Battleship game was created so I could experiment with a more complex game than the previous tic-tac-toe and rock-paper-scissors games I had created. I was able to build some simple AI logic for the computer and enjoyed the challenge of getting this game to run properly. Two things I think this code shows is my ability to use constructors effectively, and if you look closely, this was my first usage of recursion "in the wild" in my code. A "live demo" link has been provided below.</p>
